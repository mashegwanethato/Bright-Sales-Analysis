# Bright-Sales-Analysis

# 📘 Introduction
The purpose of this project was to analyse the sales and assess on which days most sales are made

# 🧰 Tools Used
Miro – Used for planning the analysis process, outlining the objectives, and mapping out the SQL queries to be used.

Snowflake – Used to perform the core data analysis. I wrote SQL queries to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset, identifying key trends and insights.

Excel – Used to visualize the results from Snowflake. I created pivot tables and graphs to better illustrate key performance trends.

Canva – Used to design a presentation that visually communicates the findings in a clear and engaging way.

Google Looker - Used to turn raw data data into interactive dashboards and automated reports, making insights easy to visualize.

# 📊 Key Findings
- Saturday is the day where the most revenue is made, the most sales took place, the highest average cost of sales was achieved, and the highest cost of sales was achieved. Therefore Satuday is where the most action takes place.
- May is the month where the most revenue is made and where the most sales took place. The other months are not that far of but May leading. 
- A loss is being made instead of profit as 91% of the profit percentage is negative.

# Conclusion
Bright TV should try by all means to create shows that make people more interested to watch during the week
